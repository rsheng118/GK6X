# GK6X

This tool allows you to set keys, macros, and lighting for GK6X keyboards (GK64, GK84, GK61, etc). This can be used as an alternative to the official software http://www.jikedingzhi.com/downloadlist?driverID=41latest

It should work on Windows, Mac, and Linux (though only Windows has been tested so far).

Converted to use .net Core 3.1 so it is easier to run corss platform
Added new keyboard type under device

## Usage

When you open the program it will connect to your keyboard. Once it has connected it will create a file `UserData/YOUR_MODEL_ID.txt`. This can be used to configure the keyboard. [See Sample.txt for examples of setting keys, macros, and lighting](https://github.com/pixeltris/GK6X/blob/master/Build/UserData/Sample.txt). Use the 'map' command to apply your changes to the keyboard, and 'unmap' to reset your keyboard to the default state (NOTE: There is no 'apply failed' message like there is on the official software, so it can fail silently!).

You can reprogram the base layer and layers 1-3 (and the Fn keys). The 'driver' layer isn't supported. The firmware doesn't allow you to reprogram the Fn keys on the base layer (which sucks!).
